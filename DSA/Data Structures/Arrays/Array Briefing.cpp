 Arrays
 
 An array is a collection of elements stored at continuos bytes of memory
 It stores elements of same data type (In C)
 Advantages 	: Finding an element in an array is easy (Time Complexity = O(1))
 Disadvantages 	: Continous bits are needed, Insertion and deletion are difficult, Non Dynamic, No index out of Box
 
 In C Language array length is Fixed once assigned.We cant expand or shrink it.
 Because we cant be sure that if next byte is free or not
 
 Using arrays for stacks is noob as we are allocating a large sting of continuos data to it even tough it might not be used
