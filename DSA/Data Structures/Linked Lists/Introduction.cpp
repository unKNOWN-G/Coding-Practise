 Introduction to linked-list Data Structure:
 
 Why liked-list? Why not array?
 1)The size is fixed in an array but its not fixed in Linked list as its dynamically allocated
 2)Insertion are deletion operations are less expensive than in array
 
 But at what cost?(Disavantages :p)
 1)Assessing a particular index element is so tough
 2)Pointer is a must
 3)Extra memory usage
 
 Generally a Linked-List DataStructure contains a datatype variable and a pointer refering to next node
